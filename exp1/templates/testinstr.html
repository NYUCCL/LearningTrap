        <p>
          You will now be tested on how well you have learned to harvest
          honey from friendly hives while avoiding dangerous hives.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          As before, you will visit each of the beehives and have
          to decide whether to harvest honey from it or avoid
          it. There have been <strong> no changes to which bee
          varieties are friendly and which are dangerous</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Just like before, collecting honey adds $0.02 to your bonus,
          getting stung subtracts $0.10, and avoiding a hive adds
          $0.00</strong>. However, in the test phase <strong>you will not
          receive any feedback</strong>. You won't be able to see
          whether the bees were friendly or dangerous, and you
          won't see any changes to your bonus.
        </p>
